## Problem

Writing User Stories

**Introduction**

Imagine that you're building a new feature for Instagram (any feature, large or small, your choice). It would be best if you wrote user stories and acceptance criteria for the new feature. The stories and acceptance criteria would help guide the project's work and articulate why the feature should be built in a particular way.

## Exercise

**Requirements**

- Determine the feature you want to build.
- Write at least five user stories for your project.
- All user stories must include 2–3 acceptance criteria.
- Stories and acceptance criteria should follow the format we discussed in class.

## Deliverable

A text file with your user stories and acceptance criteria.
